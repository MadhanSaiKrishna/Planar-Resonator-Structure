# Planar-Resonator-Structure

**Design and Simulation of a Split Ring Resonator (SRR) for Notch Filtering Applications**

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and simulation of a **Split Ring Resonator (SRR)** with a **target resonant frequency of 5 GHz**. The SRR functions as a **notch filter**, effectively attenuating signals around the resonant frequency while allowing others to pass.
